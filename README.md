## Part 1
1. Using Google Ngram Viewer and the option "Wildcard search" I found the frequency of different words following the phrase "due to the". The statistics is depicted below:

2. Further I compared the frequency of the usage of the word "access" being a noun and being a verb. Here are the results:

3. I picked up two words characteristic to British and American usage, and they are "elevator" and "lift" which actually mean the same. Here is the comparison of the usage frequency:

Thus, it is clearly seen that "lift" is used completely more often than "elevator" in both, the USA and the UK, though "lift" and "elevator" are more frequently used respectively in each country - lift for Britain and elevator for America.
