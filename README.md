## Part 1
1. Using Google Ngram Viewer and the option "Wildcard search" I found the frequency of different words following the phrase "due to the". The statistics is depicted below:

2. Further I compared the frequency of the usage of the word "access" being a noun and being a verb. Here are the results:

3. I picked up two words characteristic to British and American usage, and they are "elevator" and "lift" which actually mean the same. Here is the comparison of the usage frequency:

Thus, it is clearly seen that "lift" is used completely more often than "elevator" in both, the USA and the UK, though "lift" and "elevator" are more frequently used respectively in each country - lift for Britain and elevator for America.
## Part 2
1. Working in Sketch Engine I dignified three most frequent modifiers of the word "question":

2. By the means of the Sketch Diff I outlined the difference between the objects which may follow the words "improve" and "better".

From the results we can see that the word "perfomance" can follow the word "improve" only, "par" and "season" for "better" only and "record" suits both.
